  - NPCsays: Hello. Can you help us? The forest is full of skeletons. We even had
      to leave our beautiful cave. But we can't stay in the village. People are afraid
      of us because we're dead. That;s not fair. These skeletons are doing a bad name
      to all dead creatures. Please, can you get rid of them?
