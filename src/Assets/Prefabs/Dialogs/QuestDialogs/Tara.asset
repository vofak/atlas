  - NPCsays: Terrible Dragon Atlas has broken out of his chaines and came here, to
      this very island. He also brought an army of giant spiders, skeletons and trolls.
      Will you help me stop them?

  - NPCsays: First you need to get a sword. Find an iron sword. I think the witch
      is selling one. You can get a better one later but first I need you to get at
      least this one.
    responses:
    - text: You know what? I changed my mind. Bye bye.

  - NPCsays: You can try to get help in the castle on the hill. But they're all cowards
      there. I don't think they'll set a foot outside their precious fortress when
      there are monsters outside.

    - text: Typical

  - NPCsays: And then just go kill the dragon. Go to the forests and turn left behind
      the castle. He should be behind the huge mountain. You can take down some of
      his trolls when you're there. Any questions?
    responses:
    - text: First the sword, then the dragon. Got it. See ya
