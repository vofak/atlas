      like you around.

  - NPCsays: You haven't noticed? The forests are flooded with giant spiders, skeletons
      and I even saw a few cave trolls. Lizzard people and zombies came to the village.
      I haven't seen them for a long time. And I think Tara went mad.

    - text: Tell me about the lizard people.

  - NPCsays: There is something wrong with them. They look really scared and keep
      looking at the sea. I hope they are not thinking about swimming away. One of
      them is in the house right next to mine

  - NPCsays: They don't usually go out of their cave. But I guess all the other monsters
      in the forest drove them out. Now they are just standing behind the village

      I'm really worried about her. You should go talk to her
